Flatmap Viewer

A viewer for anatomical flatmaps generated by `flatmap-maker <https://github.com/AnatomicMaps/flatmap-maker>`_. The viewer is intended to be a component of a larger Javascript web application, although may be used standalone for local flatmap development and testing. Flatmap content is obtained from a `flatmap-server <https://github.com/AnatomicMaps/flatmap-server>`_.
